Question 1

trait Shape

class Rectangle(var width: Int, var height: Int) extends Shape {}
class Square(var side: Int) extends Shape {}
class Ellipse(var smaj: Int, var smin: Int) extends Shape {}
class Circle(var radius: Int) extends Shape {}

// Say sets are represented as lists
val l: List[Shape] = List(new Square(2), new Rectangle(3, 4), new Circle(4)) 

val squares = l.filter(_.isInstanceOf[Square]) // Identifies Squares
val circles = l.filter(_.isInstanceOf[Circle]) // Identifies Circles 

Note: A different solution uses case classes and
      pattern matching to avoid the use of isInstanceOf[]

Question 2

Area ought to be a property, rather than a state variable,
so something on the lines of exchanging "var area" for "def area"
should resolve this issue.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Question 3

The invariant may easily be invalidated by changing a slab dimension's width
field (a var):

   val s: Slab = new Slab(new Rectangle(2, 3))
   s.dimension.height = 4
   s._area = 6 != 8    

To improve the design:
1) Remove the private keyword and the accessor method, as this will
   achieve the same functionality.
2) Turn area into an attribute by changing "val _area" into "def area".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   

Question 4

r1.accept(a) // "Accepted for rendering.", because the only accept function
			 // that is a member of the Renderer class is being called
			 // on an OpaqueTriangle (which extends Triangle, so there should be
			 // no issue in doing that).
r2.accept(a) // "Accepted for ray-trace rendering.", because of the two
		     // members of RayTracingRenderer, the most particular one is being
			 // called (which is a direct member of RayTracingRenderer).

To get the output of r1.accept(a) to change modify RayTracingRenderer accordingly:

class RayTracingRenderer extends Renderer {
	override def accept(a: Triangle) = println("Accepted for ray-trace rendering.")
}

This will make r1.accept(a) to output "Accepted for ray-trace rendering.", due
to Scala using dynammic binding by default.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Question 5

class Ellipse(private var _a: Int, private var _b: Int) {
	def a = _a
	def a_=(a: Int) = {_a = a}
	def b = _b
	def b_=(b: Int) = {_b = b}
	
	// No need to override in LoggedEllipse
	def exch1 = {
		val aux = a
		a = b
		b = aux
	}

	// Override needed - illustrates the "Fragile Base Class" problem
	def exch2 = {
		val aux = _a
		_a = _b
		_b = aux
	}
}

class LoggedEllipse(private var _a: Int, private var _b: Int)
	extends Ellipse(_a, _b) {
	private var increases = 0

	def getIncreases = increases
	
	override def a_=(a: Int) = {
		if (a > _a)
			increases = increases + 1
		_a = a
	}
	override def b_=(b: Int) = {
		if (b > _b)
			increases = increases + 1
		_b = b
	} 
}


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Question 6

(a) This is called "composition" and is the industry goto for avoiding inheritance:
class PlaneText {
	private val text: Text = new Text
    ...
}

(b) Define a container trait which both Text and PlaneText inherit from:
trait Transmittable
class Text extends Transmittable { ... }
class PlaneText extends Transmittable { ... }

(c) 1. Text and PlaneText become less tightly coupled, which is surely a benefit,
       as the fragile class problem basically disappears.
    2. Another benefit is avoiding complexity.
    3. A problem is that no inheritance makes for one having to explicitly write
       out more methods (as they've lost the ability to be implicitly inherited).
    4. Also, every function call has to be forwarded to a different class, adding
       to the overhead.

Question 7

This easily fails on any test involving the standard collections:
val r1, r2 = new Rectangle(1, 2)
val coll = HashSet(r1)
coll contains r2 // false != true

// A proper Rectangle class:
class Rectangle(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
	// Proper overriding of equals, defines an equivalence relation
	override def equals(other: Any): Boolean = other match {
		case that: Rectangle => that.canEqual(this) &&
								this.width == that.width && this.height == that.height
		case _ => false
	}

	override def hashCode = 41 * width + height // For use with HashSet etc.

	def canEqual(other: Any) = other.isInstanceOf[Rectangle] // For derived classes
															 // that don't override
															 // equals
}
